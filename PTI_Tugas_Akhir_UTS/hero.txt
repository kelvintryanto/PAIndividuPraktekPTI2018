In recent times, Claude is said to be eyeing the latest research of the famed machine specialist in the city of Antoinerei, Dr. Rooney, who’s said to have invented a device that would allow its user to freely travel across the planes of existence and create mirror images.\n\nThe Captain of the Guard, Bruno, caught wind of Claude’s hallmark notice and installed monitoring devices all over Antoinerei to catch him.

Just when everyone thought this was the end of the Thief King’s reign, Claude’s mysterious partner helped Claude escape from the prison.

From his very first day at the magic academy, Valir's extraordinary control over the arcane was clear for all to see.\n\nGord, who was teaching arcane arts at the time, saw a little of himself in Valir, and began to teach the most coveted secrets of the arcane to his inquisitive pupil. However, Gord came to regret his actions, disturbed by the negative energy that began to radiate from Valir and his violent tendencies. Eventually, Valir started combining the ancient flame spells from his desert homeland with arcane power to create a unique form of arcane flame magic.\n\nGord felt he had betrayed himself, allowing his pure arcane wisdom to be tarnished by these wild flames from an unknown land. Enraged, Gord attempted to remove the power of flame from Valir's body. Valir resisted with all his might, and half of the academy was destroyed in the ensuing battle. At the end of the fracas, Gord was left feeling somewhat proud that Valir's arcane flame magic could hold up against his own pure arcane power. In the end, Valir left the academy, and Gord began working on creating a flying machine fueled by arcane energy, intent on searching the world for a new apprentice.",

Under the protection of the King of Light, they lived a peaceful life. But deep underground, the dark lord of the Abyss was plotting to invade their land. The Dark Lord sent the enchanting vampire queen, Alice, to seduce the king. The king stopped attending court and no longer cared for his once beloved queen or kingdom. The king's betrayal razed the queen's sanity in flames of jealousy, and in an attempt to win back her husband's heart, she made a deal with the dark lord to regain her youth and beauty. Every day in the kingdom, another young and beautiful maiden went missing, and a panic fell over the people. The country grew weaker with each passing day, and the sacrifices demanded by the queen's sorcery grew as well. Finally, the kingdom collapsed, with no more sacrifices to be found, and the devouring power of darkness suddenly caused the queen to become a wizened and frightening monstrosity. A thousand years have passed, and this unknown kingdom has since disappeared in the winding river of history, leaving only the legend of the demon queen.
