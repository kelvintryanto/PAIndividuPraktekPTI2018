Nana was born deep in a magic forest, and as a rare cat elf, she was naturally endowed with powerful but hard to control magic abilities. Periodic rages of magic outburst nearly took out half of her forest home, until one day the journeying moon elf Miya restrained Nana and taught this young cat elf the secrets to control her magic abilities.
